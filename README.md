MashBerry is a Raspberry PI based beer-brewing controller. 
It is designed to automate the mashing-process for the homebrewer.
MashBerry can be operated via a Web-interface or via a Display and an IR-remote. 
The temperature is controlled using a PID-controller, the temperature-measurement is done 
with a PT1000 or a Dallas 18B20. For power-control an external Solid-State-Relay is used.
